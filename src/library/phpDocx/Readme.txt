PHPDOCX is a PHP library designed to dynamically generate reports in Word format (WordprocessingML).

The reports may be built from any available data source like a MySQL database or a spreadsheet. The resulting documents remain fully editable in Microsoft Word (or any other compatible software like Open Office) and therefore the final users are able to modify them as necessary.

The formatting capabilities of the library allow the programmers to generate dynamically and programmatically all the standard rich formatting of a typical word processor.

This library also provides an easy method to generate documents in other standard formats such as PDF or HTML.

====What's new on PHPdocX 2.2?====

- OpenOffice Support. Now all the PHPdocx's generated documents are compatible with OpenOficce. Note: OpenOffice has limited support to represent some features of .docx documents.

====What are the minimum technical requirements?====
